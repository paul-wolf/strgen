Installation
============

From version 0.4.0, support for Python 2.7 is dropped. If you still need
support for Python 2, use version StringGenerator 0.3.4.

There are no dependencies beyond the Python Standard Library.

Install as standard for Python packages from PyPi:

::

   pip install StringGenerator
